Is it possible to develop a synthetic livability index for each neighbourhood, normalizing and weighting factors such as accessibility to essential services (schools, healthcare), quality and quantity of public green spaces, cultural offerings, security indicators, and digital connectivity?  
Can we apply clustering algorithms to segment city neighbourhoods into homogeneous groups (e.g., 'growing young neighbourhoods', 'consolidated residential areas', 'tertiary-focused districts') based on demographic, housing, and economic variables?  
Can we create a predictive model of congestion?
Dynamic isochrone map of the city: model that calculates for each city point the time needed to reach key places (hospitals, station, university) using optimal combination of means (public transport, sharing, walking, cycling)  
RTL modeling as complex graph: is it possible to model the entire public transport network as a graph and analyze its properties (centrality, vulnerability, connectivity)? Which nodes (stops) would cause the greatest damage to network efficiency if removed or blocked?
Commercial vitality and resilience index: is it possible to create a vitality score for each commercial axis, combining data on shop density and diversity, turnover rate (openings/closures), pedestrian flows, and presence of 'attractors' (e.g., cinemas, offices)?
Economic specialization and attractiveness: by cross-referencing business registry data with urban planning and mobility data, can we map the city's 'functional districts' (not just industrial, but also knowledge, healthcare, tourism) and analyze their attractiveness for new businesses?
Integrated climate risk map: can we build a climate risk map at individual building or block level, integrating data on heat islands, hydrogeological risk, building energy efficiency, and vulnerability of resident population (e.g., elderly living alone)?
What is the distribution of petty crime events in the urban fabric?
Anthropic pressure modeling: is it possible to develop a model that estimates 'anthropic pressure' (a crowding and wear index) for different city areas, cross-referencing data on pedestrian flows, residential density, tourist flows, venue concentration, and number of events?
