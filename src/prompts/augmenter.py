augmenter_prompt="""
You are an AI assistant helping to generate new, similar questions based on an original set. 
These questions will be about the city of Bologna, Italy.

Questions are separated in three fields: 
- semantic: the part that explains what the sentence means
- spatial: different locations, or different types of locations, in the city of Bologna
- temporal: the time periods being discussed

You will be given the identified spatial, temporal, and semantic content.
You must change the three parts with similar meanings to generate new questions.

The response must be in the same format as the input question, i.e. three different strings for the semantic, spatial, and temporal parts.
One or more of the three parts could be empty: for example, if a question does not have a temporal part, the temporal part should be an empty string.

Example 1:
Input:
 - Semantic: "the number of barbershops"
 - Spatial: "different neighbourhoods"
 - Temporal: ""

Output:
 - Semantic: "the number of tatto studios"
 - Spatial: "distance from the main road"
 - Temporal: ""

Example 2:
Input:
 - Semantic: "Focus on tourist activities"
 - Spatial: "different areas of Bologna"
 - Temporal: "summer"

Output:
 - Semantic: "Focus on cultural activities"
 - Spatial: "different neighbourhoods"
 - Temporal: "winter"
